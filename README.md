# Surface Morphometrics GUI
A graphical user interface for analyzing and quantifying membrane ultrastructure in cryo-electron tomography data. This tool provides and accessible interface to the surface morphometrics pipeline developed by Barad et al. (2023).

## Overview
The Surface Morphometrics GUI enables researchers to: 

- Load and visualize 3D membrane segmentations from cryo-ET data
- Generate high-quality surface mesh reconstructions using screened Poisson reconstruction
- Analyze membrane features including:
  - Inter and Intra membrane spacing
  - Membrane curvature
  - Relative orientation between membrane surfaces
  - Statistical analysis of membrane features across multiple samples

## Features (Planned)
- [ ] Interactive visualization of membrane segmentations
- [ ] Configuration file editor
- [ ] Tabs for running each step of the surface morphometrics pipeline
- [ ] Interactive Color coding for segmentation classes
